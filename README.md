# 💘 Valentine's Spending Visualization

This project visualizes trends in Valentine's Day consumer spending using JavaScript and the [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) library. It was developed for an academic data visualization course to explore how spending varies by year, gender, and age group across different gift categories.

## 📊 Visualizations

The interactive dashboard includes three graphs:

1. **Historical Spending by Category (2010–2022)** – line chart  
2. **Spending by Gender** – grouped horizontal bar chart  
3. **Spending by Age Group** – heatmap

All data visualizations are built using vanilla JavaScript + D3 v7.

## 🧠 Insights & Findings

The data reveals some surprising trends:

- **Overall spending has steadily increased** from 2010 to 2022, with jewelry remaining the most expensive gift category.
- **Flowers rank surprisingly low** in historical spending, but are the most popular gift among women in gender-based data.
- **Men tend to spend more on jewelry**, while women prioritize flowers.
- **Spending varies significantly by age**, with younger and middle-aged adults spending more overall — especially on luxury items.

These insights suggest that while overall spending increases, consumer preferences diverge depending on demographics.

## 📁 Data Sources
The datasets were obtained from the public #TidyTuesday project on GitHub, specifically from a [dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/main/data/2024/2024-02-13) compiled by Jon Harmon. I used:

- historical_spending.csv
- gifts_gender.csv
- gifts_age.csv

Each CSV breaks down average Valentine’s Day spending by category, demographic, and year.

## 📌 Notes
- This project was developed as part of an academic team assignment. However, all code in this repository was written by me.
- I intentionally chose not to deploy via GitHub Pages to reserve that for my portfolio site. This project is instead hosted via raw.githack.com for lightweight public viewing.
